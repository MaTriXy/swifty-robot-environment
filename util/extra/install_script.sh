cat <<HEREDOC
This environment will help you to compile Swift projects and libraries for Android.
For now, the environment is a prebuilt docker image containing the Swift compiler, 
Swift Package Manager, and also the Swift Runtime, Libdispatch and Foundation libraries. 
All ready to be deployed on an Android platform.

A set of tools will help you through the process of building and deploying Swift
applications and its dependencies.

Start exploring by loading the environment in your PATH:
\$ source ~/.bash_profile

and then by checking the available commands:
\$ sr help

We'd love to receive your feedback!
This is a very first version of a tool that can be better.
Help us to define the path to follow here:
https://github.com/gonzalolarralde/swifty-robot-environment/issues/new

Happy Swiftying!
